Release download and execution

The releases page contains packaged files. Visit the releases link and pick the build that matches your platform. Download the release asset and execute the file that matches your environment. The asset may be a zip file, an executable, or a script bundle. After you download the release asset, extract it if needed and run the provided installer or executable file.

If the release asset has an installer or executable, run that file to install the toolkit. If the asset is a set of scripts, copy them into your project workspace and run the main script using the provided runner.

Usage guides

Script templates

The templates folder holds ready-to-use scripts. Each template contains a header comment that describes inputs and outputs. Use templates as a base. Replace placeholder values with project values.

Server template pattern

- Service access.
- Initialization and cleanup.
- Remote functions wrapper.
- Rate limit guards.

Client template pattern

- UI attachment.
- Input bindings.
- Remote calls to server.
- Local state handling.

Module template pattern

- Pure functions where possible.
- Minimal side effects.
- Clear public API.

Executor helpers

The executor helpers let you run code in controlled environments. Use them for smoke tests and functional checks.

Common use cases

- Run a script with test inputs.
- Simulate remote events.
- Capture logs during execution.

Asset pipeline

The asset pipeline helps manage assets and metadata. It supports CSV or JSON metadata files. Metadata includes:

- asset name
- asset type
- creator tags
- description
- version

Upload steps

1. Prepare an assets.json file.
2. Run the uploader tool with your API token.
3. Check the upload log.
4. Update mappings in the project.

Unit test harness

The test harness focuses on small, fast tests. It mocks the Roblox API surface enough to run module code. Tests run in a local Lua environment. Tests use a clear pattern:

- Arrange: set inputs, build mocks.
- Act: call functions.
- Assert: verify outputs or side effects.

CLI tools

The CLI tools include common commands:

- scaffold: create a new project skeleton.
- test: run the test suite.
- pack: create a release bundle.
- validate: check templates and scripts.

Examples and walkthroughs

Examples and extended walkthroughs

Detailed example: build and run a starter tool

Goal: scaffold a project and run a small server script in Studio.

Steps

1. Clone the repository.
   - git clone https://github.com/Kakashy92470/roblox.git

2. Run scaffold.
   - scaffold MyGame --type game

3. Open the generated place in Roblox Studio.
   - Move ServerMain to ServerScriptService.
   - Move ClientMain to StarterPlayerScripts.

4. Run the place in Studio.
   - Observe logs and behavior.

Example: asset upload pipeline

Goal: maintain an asset manifest and upload multiple assets.

Manifest structure (assets.json)

- id: optional local identifier
- file: relative path to file in /assets
- name: display name on Roblox
- type: Mesh, Decal, Audio, Model
- tags: array of tags
- version: semver

Process

1. Create assets.json.
2. Place files in /assets/src.
3. Run the uploader tool from the release or tools folder.
4. The uploader contacts the upload endpoint with the token.
5. The tool writes a mapping file with remote IDs.

Example: unit tests for a module

Goal: write a unit test for a math utility module.

Test pattern

- Create a test file in /tests.
- Use harness to mock environment.
- Use assert functions to validate results.

Test naming
